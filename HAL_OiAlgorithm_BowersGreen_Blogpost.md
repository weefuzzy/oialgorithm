# A HAL Seed Project: Oi! Algorithm, chew on this!  

### Assaying The Noise Between Human And Algorithm  

#### John Bowers & Owen Green   

## Background

Over the course of the first two HAL meetings, as we collectively mapped out the territory of the research network, certain flavours of question seemed to crop up  that sought to stabilise what might be meant by *human* or *algorithm* (or, indeed, *listening*), and others that wondered at the kind(s) of role that certain disciplinary approaches could play in this combined effort.   Our schtick in this project is to investigate what sort of contribution practical arts research can make by approaching these putatively ontological concerns about humans and algorithms as a matters that are *inherently unstable*.  

## Ontological Noise   
Our premise is that these kinds of ontological question simply don't admit stable answers because what it is to be human, and what it is to be algorithmic are to a great extent co-indexical: that is, our (historically, culturally located) understandings of what it is to be an algorithm inflect our similarly situated understandings of what it is to be human and *vice versa*. In really complicated ways.   Of course, this stance is hardly novel. It has a great deal in common with the perspectives of much of Science and Technology Studies (e.g. Barad, Latour, Suchman), and with certain philosophies of technology (e.g. Feenberg). Feenberg, for instance, makes precisely this argument:   
>The stakes in this debate over artificial intelligence are not merely technical. If we understand computers rationalistically, as automata, we prepare a revised self-understanding along the same lines. People become information processors and decision makers, rather than participants in shared communicative activity.
 <!--Andrew Feenberg (2002). Transforming Technology: A Critical Theory Revisited. Oxford University Press, p. 106-->

Concretely, then, we might think about what our desires might be for algorithmic listeners, and how these might differ quite radically across and within disciplines. For instance, is it *universally* the case that 'one holy grail of computer music is the creation of a live musical agent whose behaviours are fully commensurate with human music making' as Nick Collins (2008) has argued? We're not sure it is. In fact, we can be quite sure it isn't.

As an example of this co-indexing in action, consider how various perfectly sensible engineering  simplifications of what sound is come to shadow our own self-conceptions as listeners. In the first instance, 'sound' is taken to be identical with vibrating air and, in turn, with some stored signal. Furthermore, it often is taken to be *literally* composed of basic elements (e.g. sinusoids + other stuff): obviously, the slippy part comes in when one makes the move from treating these bases as mathematical conveniences to treating them as perceptual facts. Again, we're still on well established territory here; Pierre Schaeffer takes musical acoustics to task for precisely these oversimplifications in the *Treatise on Musical Objects* (e.g. pp119-129, 2017 English edition), especially where it results in the assumption that human auditory perception behaves at all like a spectrum analyser. Meanwhile, much more recently, Rick Lyon finds himself having to make the same argument (Human and Machine Hearing 2017), as did Trevor Agus in his presentation at the second HAL meeting.    

Beyond merely mechanical considerations (of how inner ears and auditory cortices differ radically from bandpass filter banks), there is a much more vexatious question of meaning and its reduction into very specific (and limiting) connotations of 'information'. Herein lies the rub: wherever it is that meaning might be happening, it is not to be found solely, or even mostly, within the information that might be yielded from a signal. Instead, these are continual, contested, mucky processes, which occupy this territory between humans and algorithms that we are interested in and, crucially, are hard to know how to account for (in all their specificity) in the course of research.   

We propose to map some of this territory through a series of design provocations and a large portfolio of small collaborative makes, which are assembled in performance or installation, and critically reflected upon in the light of the concerns of the Network. Insofar as algorithms are typically conceived as trying to identify order against a background of noise, our attempts to find our way around the territory between human and algorithmic listening destabilise that concern by:
1. Providing challenging input
>oi, you algorithm, with your norms as to what counts as music...chew on this!

2. Taking noise to be its own kind of information
>oi, you algorithm, you think that is signal...chew on this!

3. Making noise-­‐fuelled *reductiones ad absurdum* of *soi-disant* high-level algorithms
>oi, you algorithm, you think that is emotion...chew on this!

4. Using algorithms intended to bring a certain kind of order to usher in disorder and discomfort
>oi, you algorithm, you want us to index massive arrays of online music... listen to these clicks!).

In this way, we open out a space for novel making as well as for provocatively interrogating our received concepts and research methods.

## Methods
We will collaborate over the course of two sessions of intensive practice-­based work, one located in Huddersfield, one in Newcastle. Our strategy will follow the character of Bowers, Bowen and Shaw’s (2016) ‘Many Makings’: a large number of small collaborative makes will be created in response to our four noisy destabilisations. A key aspect of this approach is to remain alert to the polysemy of *making*:
>*There can be many makings*. Of things, problematisations, identities, interests, ecologies, infrastructures, portfolios, federations (p.1255)

So, not only will we be making lots of *stuff* (software, hardware, sound), but we will also be interrogating the assemblages formed by us, the stuff, innocent bystanders and so forth. The results of this will form something like an annotated portfolio (Bowers and Gaver) and stimulate a paper on this topic to be directed at the NIME conference, which follows up both on these previous works of JB's as well as arguments by OG (2013, 2014) on the necessary place of practice in arts-technology interdisciplinary research.

Ahead of our practical sessions we each came up with a list of 24 ideas for makes. These run the gamut of
- identifying sources of noise (e.g. cryptographic, vocal, diode)
- instructions ('find the noise that makes you sleepy', 'Start with a 1/f source, trigger a youtube content ID claim')
- names of devices  ('pitchfinder general')
- names of pieces ('Étude for the Disagreement of Alternative Feature Extractors', 'Study for Infra-Aerophone and Intermodulation Distortion')

What these activities will yield, we believe, is a set of practical and communicable understandings / perspectives on what a playful, artistic approach to machine listening could feel like.
