## Oi, Algorithm!

This project was a collaboration between John Bowers and Owen Green, under the umbrella of a research network, [Humanising Algorithmic Listening](http://www.algorithmiclistening.org/about/), run by Alice Eldridge and Paul Stapleton. 

This repo provides a home for the various Max patches I produced along the way, as we went through a process of 'many makes', intended to probe, playfully, the idea and place of machine listening in music. 

A [blog post with more information](http://www.algorithmiclistening.org/seeds/oiA/), or a [NIME paper](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1302699) with both more information, more chutzpah, *and* more situationism.
